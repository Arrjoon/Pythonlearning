'''Different forms of Inheritance: 
1. Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance. We saw an example above.
2. Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritance. 
Unlike Java and like C++, Python supports multiple inheritance. We specify all parent classes as a comma-separated list in the bracket. 
3. Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship.
4. Hierarchical inheritance More than one derived classes are created from a single base.

5. Hybrid inheritance: This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of more than one type of inheritance.
